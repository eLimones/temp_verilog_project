/source : contains the three predictor implemetations.
/test_bench	: contains the test benches, this test benches generate the both the branch data and the result data in a file called results_*.csv, at the end of the simulation each test bench prints the total branches, total predictors hits, and total predictors misses.
/results : the results *.cvs files, this files contain the branche sequence and results, this files can be loaded in excel if needed, also the file /results/all_results.txt contains a summary of the performance of each predictor
